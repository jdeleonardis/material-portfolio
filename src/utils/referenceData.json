Jay took the time to understand the testing behind our LIMS system so that he could deliver a better product for us. He would often anticipate our needs and make suggestions for improvements and enhancements before we realized we were going to need it. No request was too large or to small for him and he never limited our creativity in the product. Jay is by far one of the best developers I have ever had the pleasure to work alongside.",
